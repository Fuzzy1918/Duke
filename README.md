# Duke---Proposal

The Goal of “Duke” is to create an
Artificial Intelligence that is able to
take audio commands and complete
them to the user’s satisfaction. These
commands will be issued in plain
english, then translated into a way
Duke can analyze what is being said
and perform the necessary action to
fulfill the command. Possible actions
Duke could perform will be to give
reports about local weather, display
time and date, play games, and can
tell jokes.
